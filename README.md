# rust-vs-java-slides
A simple SPA written in Vanilla JS to present the difference between Rust and Java.

Do you want to compare other programming langes or topics? Just replace the ``codeSnippets`` variable with your own content.
Too lazy to create content by yourself? Paste the ``codeSnippets`` content to ChatGPT and write the following prompt: "Use this JSON as a reference and replace the value for a new comparison between topicA and topicB"

Happy presenting!
