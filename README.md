# SideBySide: A Simple SPA for Comparisons
This is a simple single-page application (SPA) written in Vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate the differences between Rust and Java programming languages. The SPA allows you to switch between the pages using left/right arrow keys or by clicking on the bottom navigation.

[Try it here](https://lukaesch.github.io/sidebyside/)

## Features:
- Compare two blocks of text
- Easy navigation through pages
- Written in Vanilla JavaScript for easy modification, no SPA-framework bloatware ðŸ˜Ž
- Synthwave design

## Use Cases (ideas):
- Comparing the differences between two versions of source code
- Comparing the output of two algorithms
- Comparing the results of two experiments
- Comparing the syntax of two programming languages
- Comparing the features of two products or services
- Comparing the benefits and drawbacks of two approaches
- Comparing the differences between two texts or articles
- Comparing the results of two surveys or polls
- Comparing the prices and specifications of two products.
The opportunities are limitless!

## How to Use:
Replace the ``codeSnippets`` variable with your own content to compare other programming languages or topics.
If you don't want to create content yourself, paste the ``codeSnippets`` content to ChatGPT and write the prompt: "Use this JSON as a reference and replace the value for a new comparison between topicA and topicB".

This project is open to contributions from other developers. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.

Happy Presenting!
We hope this simple SPA helps you in your presentations and code comparison needs. Have fun!
